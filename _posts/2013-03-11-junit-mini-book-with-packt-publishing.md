## What's Going On?

I started another book in addition to the TeamCity book. This one is
intended to go much faster. It's only 100 pages. At about 25 pages
every couple weeks, this should be done in 2 months. My first chapter
is due this week.

## About the Book

For starters, it's just like the title implies. It's a mini book
(about 100 pages) about JUnit. That said, JUnit implies unit testing
with java and junit. Beyond that, this book is a cookbook or
collection of howto's an recipies about writing really good JUnit
tests.

I had a little time grasping just what context to use for java
development. We're going to cover enterprise and web applications as
well as some Android and mobile development. It's really exciting
stuff. 

Most importantly, it's a very up-to-date book on modern unit testing
and features of JUnit. It's also a good collection/reference for good
unit test development and techniques. I cover several features of
JUnit including exception handling and rules.
