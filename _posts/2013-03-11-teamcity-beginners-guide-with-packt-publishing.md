## What's Going On?

I was contracted by Packt Publishing to author a book about TeamCity
Continuous Integration by JetBrains.

## About the Book

This book is for people new to TeamCity and Continuous Integration. It
provides several step-by-step instructions on how to use and configure
TeamCity to work with your project. Project managers, configuration
managers, and developers can use this tool to improve their Agile practices.
