## What's Going On?

I was contracted by Packt Publishing to author a book about TeamCity
Continuous Integration by JetBrains. I have authored a few
publications before, but this is my first book. I'm not sure how much
time it will take out of my normal life to complete, but I am
certainly up to the task.

There's not much I can say about it until it is finished. I'll let
everyone know about my experiences writing it and what chapter I'm
currently on. I can't say much about the book itself other than the
progress I am making and what my personal feelings are.

Right now I am very excited about this book. It's going to be about 16
chapters long and I'm currently wrapping up chapter 3. The pace is
about a chapter every couple weeks, but I'm behind. In fact, I went
through a period early this year and late last year where I did
absolutely nothing on it. I am trying to push forth a bit faster.

## About the Book

This book is for people new to TeamCity and Continuous Integration. It
provides several step-by-step instructions on how to use and configure
TeamCity to work with your project. Project managers, configuration
managers, and developers can use this tool to improve their Agile practices.

It covers the basics for how to setup the software and get going with
your first project. If you've ever wondered how to get started with
this software and needed an easy way to dive in right away, this book
is exactly what you've been waiting for. That's my sales
pitch. Seriously though, I really cover just everything in the
"Beginner's" realm.
