## Sugru Build Night Returns!

For those of you who remember the [Original Sugru Build Night](/gangplank/2013/07/30/gangplank-open-hacknight-sugru-build-night/) from
earlier in July, it's back by popular demand! What's changed? Checkout my intro video below.

## More Sugru!

After the original Sugru Build Night, we knew we wanted to do more. We
wanted to go higher, shine brighter, and just be awesomer than ever
before. We just didn't know how. We were consistently blocked by the
semantically nullifying, "we don't know what we don't know." Then, the
idea struck us.

This time, we want to do a class. Just come to learn about it. We'll
do a run down on various usages and proposals for new or existing
projects. The hope is that one of us will come up with something new
and exciting or at the very least expand their hacking knowledge.

## You Can Still Bring a Project!

If you already have a project, that's great!  Your project exists
because you had a need and you willed it into creation. That's just
the kind of person you are. You discover problems and you fix
them. Sugru will earn its way into your toolbelt. 

Just as before. If you bring your project in you can:

* Learn from people have designed projects and used Sugru.
* Get people to become involved in your project to help you.
* Discover new uses for Sugru.
* See how Sugru can be fitted for your project.
* Dream of new projects that use Sugru.
* Become a Sugru project building machine.
